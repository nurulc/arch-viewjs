Node JavaScript utilities to manage and visualize architecture models

This provide a thin layer on top of vis.js library to render architecture diagrams. It is also to add a few helper functions in LiveScript. I was also trying to learn how effective functional programming in JavaScript can be.

I chose LiveScript because of the notational conventions it provides to create data and utility functions.
